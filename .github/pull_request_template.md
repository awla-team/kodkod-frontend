## PR acceptance checklist

This checklist encourages us to confirm any changes have been analyzed to reduce risks in quality, performance, reliability, security, and maintainability.

- [ ] Assignees and reviewers are set.
- [ ] All Jira issues are linked in the PR (in title or description).
- [ ] The change is as small as possible. Only one specific issue is fixed or one specific feature is implemented. Do not combine things; send separate pull requests for each issue or feature.
- [ ] Source branch is up-to-date with target (if not, merge it).
- [ ] Manual testing code (like console.log), commented code and installed dependencies that will not be needed have been removed.
- [ ] Mention any major breaking changes.
